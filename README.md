# Apple 1 Basic - Seattle Dopewars

A basic interpretation of Dopewars in a Seattle Setting on the Apple 1. Many things are not included such as police, rival gangs, or risk. Also the limitation of 8 bit math on the Apple 1 causes it to crash sometimes. Will have to adjust some values in the future to better get it work without crashing.

You can run the code from Apple 1js Emulator from [Sculinsteel](https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple1/)

Thank you to Will Scullin and The Woz
